# My OS X bash profile settings

This is heavily inspired by Nathanial Landaus blogpost ["My Mac OSX bash profile"](https://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/). Kept on GitHub for easy access.

Feel free to use it as you want(remember to rename it .bash_profile, and put it in your home root). Make the terminal work for you! :)
