# My OS X bash profile settings

This is heavily inspired by Nathaniel Landaus blogpost ["My Mac OSX bash profile"](https://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/). Kept on GitHub for easy access.

.git-completions.bash is a dependency.

Feel free to use it as you want(remember put it in your home root).

Make the terminal work for you! :)
